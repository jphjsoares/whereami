## What is whereami?
Whereami is a free alternative to geoguessr. It does not use any kind of user registration. All the streetviews are provided by Mapillary, at https://www.mapillary.com

## How does it work?
* To start a game you need a map id. 
* A map id is created when you generate a map. 
* You can generate random maps by drawing a region or a random map in the whole world.
* You can also create custom maps (selecting each location you want the map to have) for your friends to test their skills. 
* All the created map id's can be shared.
* At the end of each game, a game summary will be shown. If you want to share it with your friends you can just copy it and send it!

## Possible features:
* Multiplayer
* Native desktop app (possibly with electron)
